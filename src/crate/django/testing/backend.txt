Supported features are creating models via INSERT SQL::

    >>> from crate.django.testing.models import User
    >>> user = User.objects.create(id=1, username="mfelsche", slogan="Shut the fuck up!")
    >>> user.id
    1

We have to call refresh explicitly in order to make sure the row is available::

    >>> from django.db import connection
    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute("refresh table testing_user")

    # TODO: make this work
    # >>> User.objects.refresh()

We are able to get the columns of the created user

    >>> user.username
    'mfelsche'

    >>> user.slogan
    'Shut the fuck up!'

We are able to query for it by primary key::

    >>> del user
    >>> user = User.objects.get(id=1)
    >>> user.id
    1
    >>> user.username
    'mfelsche'
    >>> user.slogan
    'Shut the fuck up!'

And to search for it using fulltext search (using the simple match predicate)::

    >>> searched_user = User.objects.get(slogan__search='fuck')
    >>> searched_user == user
    True

Deletion is possible, too::

    >>> user.delete()

    >>> User.objects.get(id=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    crate.django.testing.models.DoesNotExist: User matching query does not exist.
